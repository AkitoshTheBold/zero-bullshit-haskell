![Zero Bullshit Haskell](exercises/test/logo.png)

Let's learn Haskell. For real this time. :rocket:

---

I'm creating videos, exercises and written content to teach you Haskell
without the bullshit. No scary jargon or pointless jerking off about types.

It's almost ready, check this space back soon. Have some ~~mona...~~ burritos
in the meantime.
