  <p>
    Write a server that exposes a <code>/string-manipulation</code> route.<br>
    The body of the response is going to be a statement, like <code>I think I could 
    survive only on pizza.</code>. <br>
    If the statement begins with <code>I'm positive</code>, it should be replaced
    with the more conservative <code>I think</code> -- return the statement unchanged otherwise.

    <pre>
      POST /string-manipulation
      I think I could survive only on pizza.
      >>> expected "I think I could survive only on pizza."

      POST /string-manipulation
      I'm positive winter is the best season.
      >>> expected "I think winter is the best season."
    </pre>
  </p>
