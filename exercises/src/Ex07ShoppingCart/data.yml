exercise: "07"
title: ShoppingCart
solution: Ex07ShoppingCart/ShoppingCart.hs
intro: |
  <p>
    Write a server that manages a shopping cart.<br>
    This is the first exercise that involves JSON. Items in the cart
    will look like <code>{ "model": "something", "quantity": 10 }</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A cart is just a list of items. Items are appended at the end of the cart.<br>
    Only adding items is supported. Expose two routes:
  </>
  <ul>
    <li><code>GET  /cart</code></li>
    <li><code>POST /cart</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The cart starts empty. Don't worry about the same item getting added twice for now.

    <pre>
      GET /cart
      >>> expected []

      POST /cart
      { "model": "first thing", "quantity": 2 }

      GET /cart
      >>> expected
        [
          { "model": "first thing", "quantity": 2 }
        ]

      POST /cart
      { "model": "another thing", "quantity": 30 }

      GET /cart
      >>> expected
        [
          { "model": "first thing", "quantity": 2 },
          { "model": "another thing", "quantity": 30 }
        ]
    </pre>
  </p>
