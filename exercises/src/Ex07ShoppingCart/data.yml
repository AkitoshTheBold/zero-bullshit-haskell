exercise: "07"
title: ShoppingCart
solution: Ex07ShoppingCart/ShoppingCart.hs
intro: |
  <p>
    Write a server that exposes two routes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>GET  /cart</code></li>
    <li><code>POST /cart</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Keep the state of a counter (starting from 0).
    The counter can only be increased.

    <pre>
      GET /current-count
      >>> expected 0

      POST /increase

      GET /current-count
      >>> expected 1

      POST /increase
      POST /increase

      GET /current-count
      >>> expected 3
    </pre>

    Don't worry about the same item getting added twice for now.
  </p>
