exercise: "05"
title: On/Off switch
intro: |
  <p>
    Write a server that exposes a <code>/onoff-switch</code> route.<br>
    The server will maintain the state of a switch. The state can either be "Off" or "On".
    The switch will start in the "Off" position. Everytime a request is sent, flip the
    switch and return the current state.

    <pre>
      POST /onoff-switch
      >>> expected "On"

      POST /onoff-switch
      >>> expected "Off"

      POST /onoff-switch
      >>> expected "On"
    </pre>
  </p>
